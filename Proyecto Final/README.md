Nonogram Solver
===============

This program solves nonogram puzzles.  Nonograms are a type of logic puzzle wherein a list of
numbers are given for each row and column signifying which cells of a grid to fill in and which to
leave blank.

For more information, please see this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram).

Installation
------------
1. Ensure that you have Python installed.  This was developed under version 3.8.10, but many other
versions of 3 should also work.  Additionally, there should not need to be many changes to get it
to work under Python 2.x if, for some reason, that is all you have available to you.

2. Clone the repository onto your computer.

3. Optional, but recommended:  Setup a virtual environment for the project.

4. Install the dependencies with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` or
`pip install -r requirements.windows.txt` on Windows.
