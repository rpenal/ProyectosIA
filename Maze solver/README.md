# Artificial Intelligence: MazeSolver (Searching Algorithms)

A labyrinth is a graphic game consisting of drawing a line from a point of origin located on the outside of a maze to a target located usually on the opposite side. The difficulty is to find a direct path to the desired place. The labyrinth, on its own configuration, contains different dead ends (of greater or lesser length) and a route correct It can take different shapes: square, oval, round, quadrangular, ec.

In this project you will build a laboratory to explore agents based on artificial intelligence that solve mazes using search algorithms. The project consists of two parts
